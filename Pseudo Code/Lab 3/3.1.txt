ALGORITHM Check(A[0..n-1])

//Input: An array A[0..n-1] of n real numbers

	x<-A[0]; y<-A[0]

	for i<-1 to n-1 do

	if A[i]<x

	x<-A[i]

	if A[i]>y

	y<- A[i]

	return y-x


  For the algorithm given above,

  1) What does this algorithm computes?

  Ans: The algorithm computes the difference of the highest value of the array and the lowest value of the array.


  2) What is its basic operation?

  Ans: The basic operation which is performed in this algorithm is the subtraction of higher and lower value.


  3) Check the no of times the basic operation is executed depends only on the size of an input or on any other parameter.

  Ans: It does not depend on the size of an input.
 

  4) Set up a sum/recurrence, expressing the number of times the basic operation is executed.

  Ans: N


  5) What is the efficiency class of the given algorithm?
	
  Ans: Efficiency of given algorithm is 0(n).
